- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items passed validation on first iteration.
- Spec covers 5 user stories (Auth Layout, Login, Register, Forgot Password, Social Login), 21 functional requirements, 7 edge cases, and 8 success criteria.
